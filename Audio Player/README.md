# Browser Based Music Player System
Use your browser as a music player software. Just drag your playlist [here](https://playmusic-z.firebaseapp.com/), and it will start playing them one by one.
Only vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML are used in this website so that anyone can easily understand code and implement it in their own project.
